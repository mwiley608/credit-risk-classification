Bootcamp Module 20 Challenge - Machine Learning Report

## Overview of the Analysis

This project uses various techniques to train and evaluate a machine learning model based on loan risk. The overall purpose of the analysis is to predict creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The data file, lending_data.csv, can be found in the Resources folder. 

The 5 major steps in the machine learning process were used in this project:
1. Define the problem - predict creditworthiness
2. Build the dataset - historical lending data
3. Train the model - Logistic Regression Model with train_test_split and RandomOverSampler modules
4. Evaluate the model - balanced_accuracy_score and classification report modules 
5. Inference - see summary for which method provided better results

The loan_status column was used for the y variable, the labels. The value options are either "0" or "1", with "0" indicating a healthy loan and "1" indicating a loan at a high risk of defaulting. Using the value_counts() function, the quantity of each type of loan was determined. The data was then split into training and testing datasets. 

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1 - Logistic Regression Model using train_test_split:
  * Balanced Accuracy Score = 95%
  * Precision & Recall of "0 - Healthy" and "1 - High Risk"

* Machine Learning Model 2 - Logistic Regression Model using RandomOverSampler:
  * Balanced Accuracy Score = 99.5%
  * Precision & Recall of "0 - Healthy" and "1 - High Risk"

## Summary

Overall, Model 2 using the RandomOverSampler module performs the best based on its 99.5% accuracy score and the 99% precision and accuracy. The object of the model is to predict creditworthiness; therefore, predicting high risk or loan_status = 1 is the primary focus. The results show that Model 1 only had an 95% accuracy and 85% precision rate at predicting high risk loans compared to the improved performance of Model 2
